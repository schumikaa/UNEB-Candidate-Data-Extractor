This is a tool to help you extract Candidates Data from a UNEB Excel File. Files submitted to UNEB or downloaded from a UNEB Portal have protected worksheets. This app will help you extract that content for further management.
You will automate the whole process as follows;
 1. Click the "Choose Multiple" Button and select the UNEB excel files you'd like to process, then click on "Copy Content" The files will be processed and stored in the source directory with the source file name prefixed with "Processed ~ "
 2. After that, select the processed excel files using the upper "Choose File" Button and click on Export. Files will be processed and saved in the source location. However, these will have a prefix "Reprocessed ~ "

This algorithm is not subject to any licenses, so feel free to edit, upgrade or manipulate as mush as you wish. Looking forward to collaborations on more serious projects.
